Overview
========


In this section we'll describe how to get the code for the Evelyn Management UI, and build and run it. 

Note that there's not much point in doing this unless you have already set up an Evelyn server. So, if you haven't done this yet, head over to `https://evelyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://evelyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and return here when you're done.
